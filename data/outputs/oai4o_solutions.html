<p>Q12. (i) Define simple harmonic motion. [1] (ii) Derive an expression for the time period of oscillation for a mass m attached to a vertical spring of force constant k. (iii) What will be the time period of this system if it is taken inside the satellite?</p>
<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
<h3 id="q12-simple-harmonic-motion-and-time-period-of-a-mass-spring-system">Q12. Simple Harmonic Motion and Time Period of a Mass-Spring System</h3>
<h4 id="i-define-simple-harmonic-motion-1">(i) Define simple harmonic motion. [1]</h4>
<p>Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and acts in the direction opposite to that displacement. Mathematically, it can be described by the equation:
[ F = -kx ]
where ( F ) is the restoring force, ( k ) is the force constant (or spring constant), and ( x ) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.</p>
<h4 id="ii-derive-an-expression-for-the-time-period-of-oscillation-for-a-mass--m--attached-to-a-vertical-spring-of-force-constant--k">(ii) Derive an expression for the time period of oscillation for a mass ( m ) attached to a vertical spring of force constant ( k ).</h4>
<p>To derive the time period ( T ) of a mass-spring system, we start with Hooke's Law and Newton's second law of motion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hooke's Law</strong>: The restoring force ( F ) is given by:
[ F = -kx ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Newton's Second Law</strong>: The force is also equal to the mass ( m ) times the acceleration ( a ):
[ F = ma ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combining the two equations</strong>:
[ ma = -kx ]
Since acceleration ( a ) is the second derivative of displacement ( x ) with respect to time ( t ):
[ m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rearranging the equation</strong>:
[ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \frac{k}{m}x = 0 ]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a second-order differential equation of the form:
[ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0 ]
where ( \omega ) (angular frequency) is:
[ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} ]</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Time Period ( T )</strong>: The time period ( T ) is related to the angular frequency ( \omega ) by:
[ T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} ]</li>
</ol>
<p>Substituting ( \omega ):
[ T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}} ]
[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} ]</p>
<p>Thus, the time period of oscillation for a mass ( m ) attached to a vertical spring of force constant ( k ) is:
[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} ]</p>
<h4 id="iii-what-will-be-the-time-period-of-this-system-if-it-is-taken-inside-the-satellite">(iii) What will be the time period of this system if it is taken inside the satellite?</h4>
<p>When the system is taken inside a satellite, it is in a state of free fall, experiencing microgravity. In this condition, the gravitational force does not affect the oscillation of the mass-spring system. The time period of the mass-spring system depends only on the mass ( m ) and the spring constant ( k ), and not on the gravitational acceleration ( g ).</p>
<p>Therefore, the time period ( T ) inside the satellite remains the same as derived in part (ii):
[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} ]</p>
<p>In conclusion, the time period of the mass-spring system inside the satellite is unchanged and is given by:
[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} ]</p>
<p>Q13. (a) State Bernoullis principle.(b) Figure 13_question_fig.png shows a liquid of density 1200 kgm-3 flowing steadily in a tube of varying cross-sections. The cross-section at point A is 1.0 cm2 and that at B is 20 mm2, points A and B are in the same horizontal plane. The speed of the liquid at A is 10 cm/s. Calculate (i) the speed at B. (ii) the difference in pressure at A and B.</p>
<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
<h3 id="q13-a-state-bernoullis-principle">Q13. (a) State Bernoulli's Principle.</h3>
<p><strong>Bernoulli's Principle</strong> states that for an incompressible, non-viscous fluid flowing in a streamline, the sum of the pressure energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit volume remains constant along any streamline. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
<p>[ P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{constant} ]</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>( P ) is the pressure within the fluid,</li>
<li>( \rho ) is the fluid density,</li>
<li>( v ) is the fluid velocity,</li>
<li>( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity,</li>
<li>( h ) is the height above a reference point.</li>
</ul>

(b) Figure 13_question_fig.png shows a liquid of density 1200 kg/m³ flowing steadily in a tube of varying cross-sections. The cross-section at point A is 1.0 cm² and that at B is 20 mm², points A and B are in the same horizontal plane. The speed of the liquid at A is 10 cm/s. Calculate (i) the speed at B. (ii) the difference in pressure at A and B.</h3>
<h4 id="i-the-speed-at-b">(i) The speed at B</h4>
<p>To find the speed at B, we use the principle of continuity, which states that the product of the cross-sectional area and the velocity of the fluid is constant along the streamline. Mathematically:</p>
<p>[ A_A v_A = A_B v_B ]</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
<li>( A_A = 1.0 , \text{cm}^2 = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} , \text{m}^2 )</li>
<li>( A_B = 20 , \text{mm}^2 = 20 \times 10^{-6} , \text{m}^2 )</li>
<li>( v_A = 10 , \text{cm/s} = 0.1 , \text{m/s} )</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to find ( v_B ):</p>
<p>[ v_B = \frac{A_A v_A}{A_B} ]</p>
<p>Substituting the values:</p>
<p>[ v_B = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-4} , \text{m}^2 \times 0.1 , \text{m/s}}{20 \times 10^{-6} , \text{m}^2} ]</p>
<p>[ v_B = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-5}}{20 \times 10^{-6}} ]</p>
<p>[ v_B = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-5}}{2 \times 10^{-5}} ]</p>
<p>[ v_B = 0.5 , \text{m/s} ]</p>
<p>So, the speed at B is ( 0.5 , \text{m/s} ).</p>
<h4 id="ii-the-difference-in-pressure-at-a-and-b">(ii) The difference in pressure at A and B</h4>
<p>Using Bernoulli's equation:</p>
<p>[ P_A + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_A^2 = P_B + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_B^2 ]</p>
<p>We need to find the difference in pressure ( \Delta P = P_A - P_B ):</p>
<p>[ \Delta P = \frac{1}{2} \rho (v_B^2 - v_A^2) ]</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
<li>( \rho = 1200 , \text{kg/m}^3 )</li>
<li>( v_A = 0.1 , \text{m/s} )</li>
<li>( v_B = 0.5 , \text{m/s} )</li>
</ul>
<p>Substituting the values:</p>
<p>[ \Delta P = \frac{1}{2} \times 1200 , \text{kg/m}^3 \times ((0.5 , \text{m/s})^2 - (0.1 , \text{m/s})^2) ]</p>
<p>[ \Delta P = 600 \times (0.25 - 0.01) ]</p>
<p>[ \Delta P = 600 \times 0.24 ]</p>
<p>[ \Delta P = 144 , \text{Pa} ]</p>
<p>So, the difference in pressure at A and B is ( 144 , \text{Pa} ).</p>

<p>Q15. (a) When the wire of a sonometer is 75 cm long, it is in resonance with a tuning fork. On shortening the wire by 0.5 cm it makes 3 beats with the same fork. The beat is the difference in frequencies. Calculate the frequency of the tuning fork.(b)The diagram below shows an experiment to measure the speed of a sound in a string. The frequency of the vibrator is adjusted until the standing wave shown in the diagram 15_question_fig.png is formed.The frequency of the vibrator is 120Hz. Calculate the speed at which a progressive wave would travel along the string.</p>
<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
<h3 id="q15-a">Q15. (a)</h3>
<p>To solve for the frequency of the tuning fork, we need to use the concept of beats and the relationship between the length of the sonometer wire and its frequency.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Given Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial length of the wire, ( L_1 = 75 ) cm</li>
<li>Shortened length of the wire, ( L_2 = 75 - 0.5 = 74.5 ) cm</li>
<li>Number of beats produced, ( n = 3 ) beats</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frequency Relationship:</strong>
The frequency of a vibrating string is inversely proportional to its length, i.e., ( f \propto \frac{1}{L} ).</p>
<p>Therefore, we can write:
[
f_1 = k \cdot \frac{1}{L_1} \quad \text{and} \quad f_2 = k \cdot \frac{1}{L_2}
]
where ( k ) is a constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculating Frequencies:</strong>
[
f_1 = k \cdot \frac{1}{75} \quad \text{and} \quad f_2 = k \cdot \frac{1}{74.5}
]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Beat Frequency:</strong>
The beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two frequencies:
[
|f_1 - f_2| = 3 \quad \text{beats}
]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Substitute and Solve:</strong>
[
\left| k \cdot \frac{1}{75} - k \cdot \frac{1}{74.5} \right| = 3
]
[
k \left| \frac{1}{75} - \frac{1}{74.5} \right| = 3
]
[
k \left| \frac{74.5 - 75}{75 \cdot 74.5} \right| = 3
]
[
k \left| \frac{-0.5}{75 \cdot 74.5} \right| = 3
]
[
k \cdot \frac{0.5}{75 \cdot 74.5} = 3
]
[
k = 3 \cdot \frac{75 \cdot 74.5}{0.5}
]
[
k = 3 \cdot 75 \cdot 149
]
[
k = 3 \cdot 11175
]
[
k = 33525
]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frequency of the Tuning Fork:</strong>
[
f_1 = k \cdot \frac{1}{75}
]
[
f_1 = 33525 \cdot \frac{1}{75}
]
[
f_1 = 447 , \text{Hz}
]</p>
<p>Therefore, the frequency of the tuning fork is <strong>447 Hz</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="q15-b">Q15. (b)</h3>
<p>To calculate the speed of the progressive wave along the string, we use the relationship between the frequency, wavelength, and speed of the wave.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Given Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency of the vibrator, ( f = 120 ) Hz</li>
<li>The standing wave pattern shows 3 loops (antinodes), which means there are 1.5 wavelengths (( \lambda )) in the length of the string.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Length of the String:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let the length of the string be ( L ).</li>
<li>Since there are 1.5 wavelengths in the length of the string:
[
L = 1.5 \lambda
]
[
\lambda = \frac{L}{1.5}
]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed of the Wave:</strong>
The speed ( v ) of the wave is given by:
[
v = f \cdot \lambda
]
Substituting ( \lambda ):
[
v = f \cdot \frac{L}{1.5}
]
[
v = \frac{120 \cdot L}{1.5}
]
[
v = 80L
]</p>
<p>Therefore, the speed at which the progressive wave travels along the string is ( 80L ) m/s, where ( L ) is the length of the string.</p>

<p>Q16.(a) State Lenz law in electromagnetism. Justify this law is in favor of the principle of conservation of energy.(b) A magnet is quickly moved in the direction indicated by an arrow between two coils C1 and C2 as shown in the figure. What will be the direction of induced current in each coil as indicated by the movement of magnet? Explain.</p>
<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
<h3 id="q16-a">Q16. (a)</h3>
<p><strong>Lenz's Law:</strong></p>
<p>Lenz's Law states that the direction of the induced electromotive force (emf) and hence the induced current in a closed loop is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
<p>[ \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} ]</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>(\mathcal{E}) is the induced emf,</li>
<li>(\Phi_B) is the magnetic flux.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Justification with Conservation of Energy:</strong></p>
<p>Lenz's Law is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy. When a change in magnetic flux induces a current, the direction of the induced current is such that it creates a magnetic field opposing the change in the original magnetic flux. This opposition requires work to be done against the induced magnetic field, ensuring that energy is conserved. If the induced current did not oppose the change, it would lead to a perpetual increase in energy, violating the conservation of energy principle.</p>
<h3 id="q16-b">Q16. (b)</h3>
<p><strong>Direction of Induced Current:</strong></p>
<p>Given the figure, let's analyze the direction of the induced current in each coil (C1 and C2) as the magnet is moved quickly in the direction indicated by the arrow.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Coil C1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the north pole of the magnet approaches coil C1, the magnetic flux through C1 increases.</li>
<li>According to Lenz's Law, the induced current in C1 will flow in a direction that opposes this increase in magnetic flux.</li>
<li>To oppose the approaching north pole, coil C1 will generate its own north pole on the side facing the magnet.</li>
<li>Using the right-hand rule, the current in coil C1 will flow in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from the magnet's side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coil C2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the north pole of the magnet moves away from coil C2, the magnetic flux through C2 decreases.</li>
<li>According to Lenz's Law, the induced current in C2 will flow in a direction that opposes this decrease in magnetic flux.</li>
<li>To oppose the receding north pole, coil C2 will generate its own south pole on the side facing the magnet.</li>
<li>Using the right-hand rule, the current in coil C2 will flow in a clockwise direction when viewed from the magnet's side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For coil C1, the induced current creates a magnetic field that opposes the increase in magnetic flux due to the approaching north pole of the magnet.</li>
<li>For coil C2, the induced current creates a magnetic field that opposes the decrease in magnetic flux due to the receding north pole of the magnet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the directions of the induced currents are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coil C1:</strong> Counterclockwise</li>
<li><strong>Coil C2:</strong> Clockwise</li>
</ul>
<p>Q17. (a) State the principle of the Potentiometer. A potentiometer isalso called a voltmeter of infinite resistance, why?

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
<h3 id="q17-a-principle-of-the-potentiometer-and-infinite-resistance-voltmeter">Q17. (a) Principle of the Potentiometer and Infinite Resistance Voltmeter</h3>
<h4 id="q17-a-principle-of-the-potentiometer">Q17. (a) Principle of the Potentiometer</h4>
<p>The principle of the potentiometer is based on the fact that the potential drop across a uniform wire is directly proportional to its length, provided the wire has a uniform cross-sectional area and the current through it is constant. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:</p>
<p>[ V \propto l ]</p>
<p>where ( V ) is the potential difference and ( l ) is the length of the wire.</p>
<h4 id="q17-a-potentiometer-as-a-voltmeter-of-infinite-resistance">Q17. (a) Potentiometer as a Voltmeter of Infinite Resistance</h4>
<p>A potentiometer is considered a voltmeter of infinite resistance because it does not draw any current from the circuit being measured. In a potentiometer, the potential difference is measured by balancing it against a known potential difference without allowing any current to flow through the galvanometer. This ensures that the measurement does not affect the circuit, which is equivalent to having an infinite resistance.</p>
<h3 id="q17-b-meter-bridge-experiment">Q17. (b) Meter Bridge Experiment</h3>
<h4 id="q17-b-i-new-position-of-balance-point">Q17. (b) (i) New Position of Balance Point</h4>
<p>Given that the initial balance point is at ( l = 20 ) cm, and the values of ( R ) and ( X ) are doubled and then interchanged, we need to determine the new balance point.</p>
<p>Initially, the balance condition is:</p>
<p>[ \frac{R}{X} = \frac{l}{100 - l} ]</p>
<p>Given ( l = 20 ) cm, we have:</p>
<p>[ \frac{R}{X} = \frac{20}{80} = \frac{1}{4} ]</p>
<p>When ( R ) and ( X ) are doubled and interchanged, the new resistances are ( 2X ) and ( 2R ). The new balance condition becomes:</p>
<p>[ \frac{2X}{2R} = \frac{l'}{100 - l'} ]</p>
<p>Since ( \frac{2X}{2R} = \frac{X}{R} = 4 ), we have:</p>
<p>[ 4 = \frac{l'}{100 - l'} ]</p>
<p>Solving for ( l' ):</p>
<p>[ 4(100 - l') = l' ]
[ 400 - 4l' = l' ]
[ 400 = 5l' ]
[ l' = 80 \text{ cm} ]</p>
<p>Thus, the new position of the balance point is ( l' = 80 ) cm.</p>
<h4 id="q17-b-ii-effect-of-interchanging-galvanometer-and-battery">Q17. (b) (ii) Effect of Interchanging Galvanometer and Battery</h4>
<p>If the galvanometer and battery are interchanged at the balance position, the balance point will not be affected. This is because the potentiometer works on the principle of null deflection, where the potential difference is balanced, and no current flows through the galvanometer. The position of the balance point depends only on the potential difference and the length of the wire, not on the position of the galvanometer or battery. Therefore, the balance point remains the same.</p>

<p>To determine the maximum frequency of incident radiation that can cause a photoelectric effect, we need to find the threshold frequency (( f_0 )). This is the frequency at which the kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is zero. From the graph, this is the point where the line intersects the frequency axis (x-axis).</p>
<p>From the graph, the threshold frequency ( f_0 ) is approximately:

<h4 id="b-calculate-the-work-function-for-sodium">(b) Calculate the work function for sodium.</h4>
<p>The work function (( \phi )) is the minimum energy required to eject an electron from the surface of the material. It can be calculated using the threshold frequency (( f_0 )) and Planck's constant (( h )):</p>
<p>[ \phi = h f_0 ]</p>
<p>Given:
[ h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js} ]
[ f_0 = 4.5 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz} ]</p>
<p>[ \phi = (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js}) \times (4.5 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}) ]
[ \phi = 2.9817 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} ]</p>
<p>To convert this to electron volts (eV):

<p>[ \phi = \frac{2.9817 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} ]

<p>The maximum kinetic energy (( K_{\text{max}} )) of the emitted photoelectrons is given by the equation:

<p>From the graph, we can determine the slope of the line, which represents ( h ). The slope is given by the change in kinetic energy divided by the change in frequency.</p>
<p>Let's take two points from the graph:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point 1: ( (f_1, K_{\text{max1}}) = (5.5 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}, 1.5 \text{ eV}) )</li>
<li>Point 2: ( (f_2, K_{\text{max2}}) = (6.5 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}, 2.5 \text{ eV}) )</li>
</ol>
<p>The slope ( h ) is:
[ h = \frac{K_{\text{max2}} - K_{\text{max1}}}{f_2 - f_1} ]</p>
<p>Convert the kinetic energy from eV to J:
[ K_{\text{max1}} = 1.5 \text{ eV} = 1.5 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} = 2.403 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} ]
[ K_{\text{max2}} = 2.5 \text{ eV} = 2.5 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} = 4.005 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} ]</p>
<p>[ h = \frac{4.005 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} - 2.403 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{6.5 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz} - 5.5 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}} ]
[ h = \frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{1 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}} ]
[ h = 1.602 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js} ]</p>
<p>This value is close to the accepted value of Planck's constant, which is ( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js} ). The discrepancy may be due to approximations made while reading the graph.</p>

<p>To find the expression for the charge of an oil drop of radius ( r ) moving with constant velocity ( v ) in a downward direction, we need to consider the forces acting on the oil drop. The forces include gravitational force, buoyant force, and viscous drag force.</p>

<p>The negative energy of an electron in an orbit signifies that the electron is bound to the nucleus. In other words, the electron is in a stable state and requires energy to be added to it in order to be freed from the attraction of the nucleus. This negative energy is a result of the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged nucleus. The more negative the energy, the more tightly the electron is bound to the nucleus.</p>

<h3 id="q21">Q21.</h3>
<h4 id="a-change-in-intensity-with-distance">(a) Change in Intensity with Distance</h4>
<p>The intensity of sound ( I ) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance ( r ) from the source. This relationship is given by the inverse square law:</p>
<p>[ I \propto \frac{1}{r^2} ]</p>
<p>If the distance from the source changes by four times, the new distance ( r' ) is:</p>
<p>[ r' = 4r ]</p>
<p>The new intensity ( I' ) can be expressed as:</p>
<p>[ I' \propto \frac{1}{(4r)^2} = \frac{1}{16r^2} ]</p>
<p>Thus, the intensity of the sound heard by the observer will be:</p>
<p>[ I' = \frac{I}{16} ]</p>
<p>So, the intensity of the sound decreases by a factor of 16 when the distance is increased by four times.</p>
<h4 id="b-frequency-heard-by-a-passenger-on-another-train">(b) Frequency Heard by a Passenger on Another Train</h4>
<p>The Doppler effect formula for sound when both the source and the observer are moving is:</p>
<p>[ f' = f \left( \frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \right) ]</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>( f' ) is the observed frequency,</li>
<li>( f ) is the emitted frequency (262 Hz),</li>
<li>( v ) is the speed of sound in air (340 m/s),</li>
<li>( v_o ) is the speed of the observer (18 m/s),</li>
<li>( v_s ) is the speed of the source (30 m/s).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(i) When the observer is approaching the source:</strong></p>
<p>[ f' = 262 \left( \frac{340 + 18}{340 - 30} \right) ]</p>
<p>[ f' = 262 \left( \frac{358}{310} \right) ]</p>
<p>[ f' \approx 262 \times 1.1548 ]</p>
<p>[ f' \approx 302.56 \text{ Hz} ]</p>
<p><strong>(ii) When the observer is receding from the source:</strong></p>
<p>[ f' = 262 \left( \frac{340 - 18}{340 + 30} \right) ]</p>
<p>[ f' = 262 \left( \frac{322}{370} \right) ]</p>
<p>[ f' \approx 262 \times 0.8703 ]</p>
<p>[ f' \approx 228.82 \text{ Hz} ]</p>
<h4 id="c-maximum-displacement-in-a-sinusoidal-sound-wave">(c) Maximum Displacement in a Sinusoidal Sound Wave</h4>
<p>The relationship between the maximum pressure variation ( \Delta P_{\text{max}} ) and the maximum displacement ( s_{\text{max}} ) in a sound wave is given by:</p>
<p>[ \Delta P_{\text{max}} = B k s_{\text{max}} ]</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>( B ) is the bulk modulus of the medium (1.42 × 10(^5) Pa),</li>
<li>( k ) is the wave number,</li>
<li>( s_{\text{max}} ) is the maximum displacement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The wave number ( k ) is related to the wavelength ( \lambda ) by:</p>
<p>[ k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} ]</p>
<p>The wavelength ( \lambda ) can be found using the speed of sound ( v ) and the frequency ( f ):</p>
<p>[ \lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{344 \text{ m/s}}{1000 \text{ Hz}} = 0.344 \text{ m} ]</p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<p>[ k = \frac{2\pi}{0.344} \approx 18.26 \text{ m}^{-1} ]</p>
<p>Now, substituting the values into the pressure variation equation:</p>
<p>[ 3.0 \times 10^{-2} \text{ Pa} = 1.42 \times 10^5 \text{ Pa} \times 18.26 \text{ m}^{-1} \times s_{\text{max}} ]</p>
<p>Solving for ( s_{\text{max}} ):</p>
<p>[ s_{\text{max}} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{-2}}{1.42 \times 10^5 \times 18.26} ]</p>
<p>[ s_{\text{max}} \approx \frac{3.0 \times 10^{-2}}{2.591 \times 10^6} ]</p>
<p>[ s_{\text{max}} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m} ]</p>
<p>So, the maximum displacement is approximately ( 1.16 \times 10^{-8} \text{ m} ).</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
<h3 id="q22-a-what-is-choke-coil">Q22. (a) What is choke coil?</h3>
<p>A choke coil is an inductor used to block higher-frequency alternating current (AC) in an electrical circuit while allowing lower-frequency or direct current (DC) to pass. It typically consists of a coil of wire wound around a magnetic core. The inductance of the coil creates a reactance that impedes the flow of AC, especially at higher frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="q22-b-why-is-it-preferred-over-a-resistor-in-ac-circuit">Q22. (b) Why is it preferred over a resistor in AC circuit?</h3>
<p>A choke coil is preferred over a resistor in an AC circuit because it can limit the current without dissipating much power as heat. In a resistor, the power dissipation is given by ( P = I^2 R ), where ( I ) is the current and ( R ) is the resistance. This results in energy loss in the form of heat. In contrast, a choke coil primarily stores energy in its magnetic field and releases it back into the circuit, resulting in minimal energy loss. This makes the choke coil more efficient for controlling AC current.</p>
<h3 id="q22-c-in-figures-a-b-and-c-in-placeholder-three-ac-circuits-with-equal-currents-have-been-shown">Q22. (c) In figures (a), (b), and (c) in {placeholder}, three AC circuits with equal currents have been shown.</h3>
<h4 id="q22-ci-if-the-frequency-of-emf-is-increased-then-what-will-be-the-effect-on-the-currents-flowing-in-them-explain">Q22. (c)(i) If the frequency of e.m.f. is increased, then what will be the effect on the currents flowing in them? Explain.</h4>
<p>To answer this, we need to consider the impedance of each circuit component:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inductor (L):</strong> The impedance ( Z_L = j\omega L ), where ( \omega = 2\pi f ) is the angular frequency. As the frequency ( f ) increases, the inductive reactance ( \omega L ) increases, thus reducing the current.</li>
<li><strong>Capacitor (C):</strong> The impedance ( Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C} ). As the frequency ( f ) increases, the capacitive reactance ( \frac{1}{\omega C} ) decreases, thus increasing the current.</li>
<li><strong>Resistor (R):</strong> The impedance ( Z_R = R ) is independent of frequency, so the current remains unchanged with frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the circuit with an inductor (figure (a)), the current will decrease as the frequency increases.</li>
<li>In the circuit with a capacitor (figure (b)), the current will increase as the frequency increases.</li>
<li>In the circuit with a resistor (figure (c)), the current will remain unchanged as the frequency increases.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="q22-cii-what-difference-do-you-expect-in-the-opposition-provided-by-circuits-for-the-current-flow-in-figure-a-and-b-if-given-ac-emf-is-replaced-by-its-equivalent-dc-emf">Q22. (c)(ii) What difference do you expect in the opposition provided by circuits for the current flow in figure (a) and (b) if given AC e.m.f. is replaced by its equivalent DC e.m.f.?</h4>
<p>When the AC e.m.f. is replaced by its equivalent DC e.m.f.:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inductor (figure (a)):</strong> For DC, the frequency ( f = 0 ), so the inductive reactance ( \omega L = 0 ). The inductor behaves like a short circuit (ideal inductor has zero resistance), offering no opposition to the DC current.</li>
<li><strong>Capacitor (figure (b)):</strong> For DC, the frequency ( f = 0 ), so the capacitive reactance ( \frac{1}{\omega C} ) becomes infinite. The capacitor behaves like an open circuit, offering infinite opposition to the DC current.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inductor will provide no opposition to the DC current.</li>
<li>The capacitor will provide infinite opposition to the DC current.</li>
</ul>
