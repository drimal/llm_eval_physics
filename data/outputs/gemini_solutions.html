[1] (ii) Derive an expression for the time period of oscillation for a
mass m attached to a vertical spring of force constant k. (iii) What
will be the time period of this system if it is taken inside the
satellite? ## Answer <strong>Q12.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i) Definition of Simple Harmonic Motion</strong></p>
<p>Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a periodic motion in which the
restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the
equilibrium position and acts in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Derivation of Time Period for a Mass-Spring
System</strong></p>
<p>For a mass m attached to a vertical spring of force constant k, the
equation of motion is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\]</span></p>
<p>where x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.</p>
<p>The solution to this equation is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x(t) = A\cos(\omega t +
\phi)\]</span></p>
<p>where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and ϕ is the
phase angle.</p>
<p>The time period T is the time taken for one complete oscillation,
which is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the angular frequency from the equation of motion, we
get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>(iii) Time Period Inside a Satellite</strong></p>
<p>Inside a satellite, the system is in free fall and experiences
weightlessness. Therefore, the restoring force is not due to gravity but
due to the spring force. The equation of motion becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\]</span></p>
<p>The time period is still given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the time period of the system inside the satellite is the
same as that outside the satellite.## Question Q13. (a) State Bernoullis
principle.(b) Figure 13_question_fig.png shows a liquid of density 1200
kgm-3 flowing steadily in a tube of varying cross-sections. The
cross-section at point A is 1.0 cm2 and that at B is 20 mm2, points A
and B are in the same horizontal plane. The speed of the liquid at A is
10 cm/s. Calculate (i) the speed at B. (ii) the difference in pressure
at A and B. ## Answer <strong>Q13.</strong> <strong>a)</strong>
Bernoulli’s principle states that the pressure of a fluid decreases as
its velocity increases.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> (i) The equation of continuity states that the
mass flow rate of a fluid is constant. This means that the product of
the density of the fluid, the cross-sectional area of the tube, and the
velocity of the fluid is constant.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\rho_1A_1v_1=\rho_2A_2v_2\]</span></p>
<p>where (_1) and (v_1) are the density and velocity of the fluid at
point 1, and (_2) and (v_2) are the density and velocity of the fluid at
point 2.</p>
<p>Using the equation of continuity, we can find the velocity of the
fluid at point B:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[v_2=\frac{\rho_1A_1v_1}{\rho_2A_2}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the given values, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[v_2=\frac{(1200\text{
kgm}^{-3})(1.0\text{ cm}^2)(10\text{ cm/s})}{(1200\text{
kgm}^{-3})(20\text{ mm}^2)}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[v_2=2.5\text{ cm/s}\]</span></p>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li>The difference in pressure between points A and B is given by the
Bernoulli equation:</li>
</ol>
<p><span
class="math display">\[P_1+\frac{1}{2}\rho_1v_1^2=P_2+\frac{1}{2}\rho_2v_2^2\]</span></p>
<p>where (P_1) and (P_2) are the pressures at points 1 and 2,
respectively.</p>
<p>Substituting the given values, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_1+\frac{1}{2}(1200\text{
kgm}^{-3})(10\text{ cm/s})^2=P_2+\frac{1}{2}(1200\text{
kgm}^{-3})(2.5\text{ cm/s})^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_1-P_2=600\text{ Pa}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the difference in pressure between points A and B is 600
Pa.## Question Q14. (a) Draw a PV diagram of a petrol engine and explain
its working based on its PV diagram. (b) Compare the efficiency of
petrol engine with that of diesel engine based on their compression
ratios. ## Answer <strong>Q14. (a) PV diagram of a petrol
engine</strong></p>
<p>The PV diagram of a petrol engine shows the pressure-volume
relationship of the air-fuel mixture in the engine’s cylinder during one
complete cycle. The cycle consists of four strokes: intake, compression,
power, and exhaust.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intake stroke:</strong> The intake valve opens, and the
piston moves down, drawing air-fuel mixture into the cylinder. The
pressure in the cylinder decreases as the volume increases.</li>
<li><strong>Compression stroke:</strong> The intake valve closes, and
the piston moves up, compressing the air-fuel mixture. The pressure and
temperature in the cylinder increase as the volume decreases.</li>
<li><strong>Power stroke:</strong> The spark plug ignites the air-fuel
mixture, causing it to burn rapidly. The pressure in the cylinder
increases rapidly as the volume increases.</li>
<li><strong>Exhaust stroke:</strong> The exhaust valve opens, and the
piston moves up, expelling the burned gases from the cylinder. The
pressure in the cylinder decreases as the volume decreases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PV diagram of a petrol engine is shown below:</p>
<p>[Image of a PV diagram of a petrol engine]</p>
<p><strong>Q14. (b) Comparison of the efficiency of petrol engine with
that of diesel engine based on their compression ratios</strong></p>
<p>The efficiency of an engine is defined as the ratio of the work
output to the heat input. The work output is the area enclosed by the PV
diagram, and the heat input is the area under the PV diagram.</p>
<p>The compression ratio of an engine is the ratio of the volume of the
cylinder at the end of the compression stroke to the volume of the
cylinder at the end of the intake stroke. A higher compression ratio
means that the air-fuel mixture is compressed more before it is
ignited.</p>
<p>Diesel engines have higher compression ratios than petrol engines.
This is because diesel fuel is more difficult to ignite than petrol, so
it needs to be compressed more to reach its ignition temperature.</p>
<p>The higher compression ratio of diesel engines results in a higher
efficiency. This is because the higher compression ratio means that the
air-fuel mixture is compressed more before it is ignited, which results
in a more complete combustion.</p>
<p>The following table compares the efficiency of petrol engines and
diesel engines:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Engine type</th>
<th>Compression ratio</th>
<th>Efficiency</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Petrol engine</td>
<td>8:1 to 12:1</td>
<td>25% to 35%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Diesel engine</td>
<td>14:1 to 25:1</td>
<td>35% to 45%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As can be seen from the table, diesel engines have a higher
efficiency than petrol engines. This is due to their higher compression
ratios.## Question Q15. (a) When the wire of a sonometer is 75 cm long,
it is in resonance with a tuning fork. On shortening the wire by 0.5 cm
it makes 3 beats with the same fork. The beat is the difference in
frequencies. Calculate the frequency of the tuning fork.(b)The diagram
below shows an experiment to measure the speed of a sound in a string.
The frequency of the vibrator is adjusted until the standing wave shown
in the diagram 15_question_fig.png is formed.The frequency of the
vibrator is 120Hz. Calculate the speed at which a progressive wave would
travel along the string. ## Answer Q15. (a) When the wire of a sonometer
is 75 cm long, it is in resonance with a tuning fork. On shortening the
wire by 0.5 cm it makes 3 beats with the same fork. The beat is the
difference in frequencies. Calculate the frequency of the tuning
fork.</p>
<p>Let the frequency of the tuning fork be f. When the wire is 75 cm
long, the wavelength of the standing wave is 2 x 75 = 150 cm. When the
wire is shortened by 0.5 cm, the wavelength of the standing wave is 2 x
(75 - 0.5) = 149 cm. The difference in wavelength is 150 - 149 = 1 cm.
The beat frequency is the difference in frequency between the two
standing waves. The beat frequency is given by: <span
class="math display">\[f_b = f_1 - f_2\]</span> where f_1 is the
frequency of the standing wave with the longer wavelength and f_2 is the
frequency of the standing wave with the shorter wavelength. The beat
frequency is also given by: <span class="math display">\[f_b =
\frac{v}{\lambda_1} - \frac{v}{\lambda_2}\]</span> where v is the speed
of the wave and (_1) and (_2) are the wavelengths of the two standing
waves. Equating the two expressions for the beat frequency, we get:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{v}{\lambda_1} - \frac{v}{\lambda_2} =
f_1 - f_2\]</span> Substituting the values into the equation, we get:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{v}{150} - \frac{v}{149} = 3\]</span>
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 149 x 150, we get: <span
class="math display">\[149v - 150v = 44700\]</span> Subtracting 149v
from both sides of the equation, we get: <span class="math display">\[-v
= 44700\]</span> Dividing both sides of the equation by -1, we get:
<span class="math display">\[v = 44700\]</span> The speed of the wave is
44700 cm/s. The frequency of the tuning fork is given by: <span
class="math display">\[f = \frac{v}{\lambda}\]</span> Substituting the
values into the equation, we get: <span class="math display">\[f =
\frac{44700}{150}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[f = 298\]</span>
The frequency of the tuning fork is 298 Hz.</p>
<p>(b)The diagram below shows an experiment to measure the speed of a
sound in a string. The frequency of the vibrator is adjusted until the
standing wave shown in the diagram 15_question_fig.png is formed.The
frequency of the vibrator is 120Hz. Calculate the speed at which a
progressive wave would travel along the string.</p>
<p>The speed of a progressive wave is given by the equation: <span
class="math display">\[v = f\lambda\]</span> where f is the frequency of
the wave and () is the wavelength of the wave. In this experiment, the
frequency of the vibrator is 120 Hz and the wavelength of the standing
wave is 2 x 75 cm = 150 cm. Therefore, the speed of the progressive wave
is: <span class="math display">\[v = f\lambda = 120 \text{ Hz} \times
150 \text{ cm} = 18000 \text{ cm/s}\]</span> The speed of the
progressive wave is 18000 cm/s.## Question Q16. 16. (a) State Lenz law
in electromagnetism. Justify this law is in favor of the principle of
conservation of energy.(b) A magnet is quickly moved in the direction
indicated by an arrow between two coils C1 and C2 as shown in the
figure. What will be the direction of induced current in each coil as
indicated by the movement of magnet? Explain. ## Answer
<strong>Q16.</strong> <strong>a)</strong> Lenz’s law states that the
direction of the induced current is such that it opposes the change in
magnetic flux. This is a consequence of the principle of conservation of
energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. In the
case of electromagnetic induction, the induced current creates a
magnetic field that opposes the change in magnetic flux. This is because
the magnetic field of the induced current interacts with the magnetic
field of the magnet, creating a force that opposes the motion of the
magnet.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> The direction of the induced current in each coil
can be determined using Lenz’s law. The magnet is moving towards coil
C1, so the magnetic flux through C1 is increasing. This will induce a
current in C1 that flows in such a way as to oppose the increase in
magnetic flux. This means that the current in C1 will flow clockwise.
The magnet is moving away from coil C2, so the magnetic flux through C2
is decreasing. This will induce a current in C2 that flows in such a way
as to oppose the decrease in magnetic flux. This means that the current
in C2 will flow counterclockwise.</p>
<p>The direction of the induced current in each coil can also be
determined using Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, which
states that the magnitude of the induced emf is equal to the negative of
the rate of change of magnetic flux. In this case, the magnetic flux is
changing due to the motion of the magnet. The negative sign in Faraday’s
law indicates that the induced emf will oppose the change in magnetic
flux.## Question Q17. (a) State the principle of the Potentiometer. A
potentiometer isalso called a voltmeter of infinite resistance, why? (b)
In the meter bridge experiment 17_question_fig.png, the balance point
was observed at J with l=20cm.(i) The values of R and X were doubled and
then interchanged. What would be the new position of balance point? (ii)
If the galvanometer and battery are interchanged at the balance
position, how will the balance point get affected? ## Answer Q17. (a) A
potentiometer is a device that can be used to measure an unknown voltage
by comparing it to a known voltage. It consists of a long, thin wire of
uniform resistance, with a battery and a voltmeter connected at one end.
When a current is passed through the wire, the voltage between the
battery and the voltmeter will be proportional to the length of wire
between the two points.</p>
<p>The principle of the potentiometer is that the voltage between two
points on a wire is proportional to the length of wire between the two
points. This is because the resistance of a wire is proportional to its
length, and the voltage between two points is equal to the current
flowing through the wire multiplied by the resistance of the wire.</p>
<p>A potentiometer is also called a voltmeter of infinite resistance
because the voltmeter is connected to the wire at a point that is not
connected to the battery. This means that the voltmeter does not draw
any current from the wire, and so the voltage between the two points is
not affected by the presence of the voltmeter.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><ol type="i">
<li>If the values of R and X were doubled and then interchanged, the new
position of balance point would be at l/2. This is because the
resistance of the wire is now 2R + 2X, and the voltage between the
battery and the voltmeter is now 2V. The balance point is the point at
which the voltage between the battery and the voltmeter is equal to the
voltage between the two points on the wire, so the balance point will be
at l/2.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li>If the galvanometer and battery are interchanged at the balance
position, the balance point will not be affected. This is because the
galvanometer and the battery are both connected to the wire at the same
point, so the voltage between the two points will not be affected.##

kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons as the frequency of the
incidentradiation on a sodium plate is varied.(a)From the graph
determine the maximum frequency of incident radiation that can cause a
photoelectric effect? (b) Calculate the work function for sodium. (c)
Use the graph to calculate the value of the Planck constant in Js. ##
Answer Q18.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>From the graph, we can see that the maximum frequency of incident
radiation that can cause a photoelectric effect is (6.2^{14}).</p></li>
<li><p>The work function for sodium can be calculated using the
equation:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_0 = hf_0\]</span></p>
<p>where (E_0) is the work function, (h) is the Planck constant, and
(f_0) is the threshold frequency.</p>
<p>From the graph, we can see that the threshold frequency is
(5.0^{14}). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_0 = (6.626\times10^{-34}\text{
Js})(5.0\times10^{14}\text{ Hz}) = 3.31\times10^{-19}\text{
J}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the work function for sodium is (3.31^{-19}).</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>The value of the Planck constant can be calculated using the
equation:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[h = \frac{E_0}{f_0}\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the values of (E_0) and (f_0) that we found in parts (b)
and (a) into this equation, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[h = \frac{3.31\times10^{-19}\text{
J}}{5.0\times10^{14}\text{ Hz}} = 6.62\times10^{-34}\text{

<p>Therefore, the value of the Planck constant is (6.62^{-34}).</p>

<p>Q19. (a) Figure 19_question_fig.png shows the experimental setup of
Millikan’s oil drop experiment. Find the expression for a charge of an
oil drop of radius r moving with constant velocity v in a downward

applied between the two horizontal plates just balances an oil drop with
4 electrons attached to it and mass of oil drop is 1.3x10-14 kg. ##
Answer Q19. (a) Let q be the charge of the oil drop. The forces acting
on the oil drop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gravitational force: <span class="math display">\[F_g =
mg\]</span></li>

<li>Electric force: <span class="math display">\[F_e = qE\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>where m is the mass of the oil drop, g is the acceleration due to
gravity, is the density of the oil, V is the volume of the oil drop, and
E is the electric field strength.</p>
<p>Since the oil drop is moving with constant velocity, the net force
acting on it is zero. Therefore,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F_g + F_b + F_e = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the expressions for the forces into the equation, we
get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[mg + \rho Vg + qE = 0\]</span></p>

maximum displacement if the frequency is 1000Hz.in air at normal
atmospheric pressure and density. The speed of sound is 344m/s and the
bulk modulus of the medium is 1.42x105 Pa. ## Answer
<strong>Q21.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> The intensity of sound is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = \frac{P^2}{2\rho v}\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the intensity of sound in
W/m^2</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the sound pressure in
Pa</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the density of the
medium in kg/m^3</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the speed of sound in
m/s</li>
</ul>
<p>If the distance between the observer and the source changes by a
factor of 4, then the sound pressure will change by a factor of 4. This
is because the sound pressure is inversely proportional to the distance
from the source. Therefore, the intensity of sound will change by a
factor of 16.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong></p>
<p><strong>i)</strong> When the two trains are approaching each other,
the observed frequency is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f&#39; = f\left(\frac{v + v_o}{v -
v_s}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f&#39;\)</span> is the observed
frequency</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the source frequency</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the speed of sound</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v_o\)</span> is the speed of the
observer</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v_s\)</span> is the speed of the
source</li>
</ul>
<p>Substituting the given values, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f&#39; = 262\left(\frac{340 + 18}{340 -
30}\right) = 302.4\text{ Hz}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>ii)</strong> When the two trains are receding from each
other, the observed frequency is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f&#39; = f\left(\frac{v - v_o}{v +
v_s}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the given values, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f&#39; = 262\left(\frac{340 - 18}{340 +
30}\right) = 227.6\text{ Hz}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> The maximum displacement is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A = \frac{P}{\omega\rho v}\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the maximum displacement
in m</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the sound pressure in
Pa</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is the angular frequency
in rad/s</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the density of the
medium in kg/m^3</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the speed of sound in
m/s</li>
</ul>
<p>Substituting the given values, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A =
\frac{3.0\times10^{-2}}{2\pi(1000)(1.29)(344)} = 1.16\times10^{-8}\text{
m}\]</span></p>

<strong>Q22.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) What is choke coil?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A choke coil is an inductor used to limit
the flow of alternating current (AC) in a circuit. It consists of a coil
of wire wound around a ferromagnetic core.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Why is it preferred over a resistor in ac
circuit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A choke coil is preferred over a resistor in
an AC circuit because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inductive reactance:</strong> A choke coil offers inductive
reactance (XL) to the flow of AC, which opposes the flow of current.
This reactance increases with frequency, making it more effective at
limiting high-frequency currents.</li>
<li><strong>Power dissipation:</strong> Resistors dissipate power as
heat, while choke coils do not. This makes choke coils more efficient in
AC circuits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(c) In figures (a), (b) and (c) in {placeholder}, three ac
circuits with equal currents have been shown.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i) If the frequency of e.m.f.be increased, then what will be
effect on the currents flowing in them? Explain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If the frequency of the EMF is increased,
the inductive reactance of the choke coil will increase. This will cause
the current flowing through the circuit to decrease.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Inductive reactance (XL) is given by:</p>
<pre><code>XL = 2πfL</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>f is the frequency of the EMF</li>
<li>L is the inductance of the choke coil</li>
</ul>
<p>As the frequency increases, the inductive reactance increases, which
opposes the flow of current. Therefore, the current flowing through the
circuit will decrease.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) What difference do you expect in the opposition provided
by circuits for the current flow in figure (a) and (b) if given a.c.
e.m.f. is replaced by its equivalent d.c. e.m.f.?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If the AC EMF is replaced by its equivalent
DC EMF, the choke coil in circuit (a) will provide no opposition to the
current flow, while the resistor in circuit (b) will continue to provide
resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circuit (a):</strong> When DC EMF is applied, the choke coil
becomes an open circuit because it has no resistance to DC current.
Therefore, it will not provide any opposition to the current flow.</li>
<li><strong>Circuit (b):</strong> The resistor in circuit (b) will
continue to provide resistance to the current flow, regardless of
whether AC or DC EMF is applied.
